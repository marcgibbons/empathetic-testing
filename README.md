# Empathetic Testing - Examples

## DjangoConUS 2023 - Presentation example

This codebase shows the evolution of a test suite suffering from an
implementation bias, and therefore, is difficult to refactor, to one which employs
empathy toward future developers.

It is split by branch to group the areas of focus. The presentation slides are
also included in the main branch.
